## üõ†Ô∏è Key Features at a Glance

*   **Dynamic Search Engine:** Switch between Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo, and more on the fly.
*   **Live Search Suggestions:** Get instant search suggestions as you type.
*   **JSON-Powered Shortcuts:** Easily add, remove, and categorize links by editing a single `shortcuts.json` file.
*   **Modern UI/UX:** A sleek dark-mode interface with smooth animations and a responsive design.
*   **Smart Categorization:** Organize shortcuts into main-screen blocks and full-screen modals.
*   **Lightweight & Fast:** Built with pure vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS for near-instant load times.

## üîß Configuration

Customizing your shortcuts is incredibly simple. All links and their categories are managed in the **`shortcuts.json`** file.

1.  Open `shortcuts.json`.
2.  Find the category you want to edit (e.g., `"tools"`, `"productivity"`).
3.  Add or remove shortcut objects. Each object needs a `name`, `url`, and `icon` link.

```json
{
  "tools": [
    { 
      "name": "Gmail", 
      "url": "https://mail.google.com", 
      "icon": "https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?sz=64&domain=gmail.com" 
    }
  ]
}
```
